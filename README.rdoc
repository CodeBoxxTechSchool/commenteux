Add the following line to your Gemfile

=== Rails 4

  gem 'commenteux'

== Usage

Mount the commenteux gem in your routes:

  mount Commenteux::Engine => "/"

====Include the needed javascript file in your application.js or application.js.coffee

==== Javascript
    //= require commenteux/application
==== CoffeeScript
    #= require commenteux/application


The routes that will be available are :

       GET  /commenteux/:resource/:resource_id(.:format)     commenteux/notes#index
       GET  /commenteux/:resource/:resource_id/new(.:format) commenteux/notes#new
       POST /commenteux/:resource/:resource_id(.:format)     commenteux/notes#create

where :resource is the name of your model (you can use namespace)

Call url of commenteux screens, for exemple, like that:

  <%= link_to "<i class='icon-file-text text-blue'></i> Notes".html_safe,
                "/commenteux/client::contract/#{@contract.id}?parent_div=ajax_target",
                :id => "notes_tab", :data => {:remote => true} %>

With a binding like that in your application.js

  $(document).delegate '#notes_tab', 'ajax:success', (e, data, status, xhr) ->
    console.log(xhr.responseText)
    $('.tab_header').removeClass('active')
    $('#notes_tab_header').addClass('active')
    $('#ajax_target').html(xhr.responseText)
